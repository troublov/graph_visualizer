# graph_visualizer
New method "draw_graph" was added to build and visualize graph. Also method "write_to_file" created that allows you to specify path to .dot file to write source code in dot.

In repository are included files with graph in .dot for "hw_4_5_dataset.fasta" and an example of resulting graph for k=55 in case of very small fasta in .pdf.
